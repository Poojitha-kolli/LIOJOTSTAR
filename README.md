Project Overview

Domain: Telecom & Streaming Services       Function: Strategy & Operations

Lio, a leading telecom provider in India, is planning to merge with Jotstar, a well-known OTT platform. 
This merger aims to combine LioCinema’s large subscriber base with Jotstar’s diverse content library to create a top streaming service in India.
To make informed decisions, Lio’s management wants to analyze data from both platforms, focusing on subscriber trends, content consumption, inactivity patterns, and subscription changes over the past year (January – November 2024).
As the data analyst, my role is to study the provided datasets, identify key insights, and present recommendations.
